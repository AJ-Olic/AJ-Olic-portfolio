        description: `Conducted a System Vulnerability Review for reactor coolant (RCS) and chemical volume control (CVCS) systems at an operating nuclear plant, analyzing 10+ years of operational data and interviewing plant personnel. Verified seismic analysis calculations using response spectra from 5 earthquake scenarios, then modeled structural response in ANSYS to generate displacement-time graphs at critical nodes using MATLAB. Validated structural calculations in Mathcad for pipe loads, lifting loads, beam deflection, and failure analysis. Performed graphite oxidation analysis (surface, chronic, thermal, and radiolytic oxidation) in MATLAB and Mathcad. Designed a standardized issue-tracking workflow in GitLab to organize design changes. Work subject to NDA restrictions.`,
