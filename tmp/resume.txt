WORK EXPERIENCE
MPR Associates, Alexandria, VA, Co-Op Engineer July 2025 – December 2025
• Entrusted with multiple concurrent projects, interacted directly with clients and presented to senior leadership.
• Conducted a System Vulnerability Review for the Reactor Coolant System and the Chemical and Volume
Control System at an operating nuclear plant by analyzing 10+ years of plant data (LTAMS, VMAS, CRs,
CARs, IRIS), interviewing plant personnel, and benchmarking against industry best practices. Identified critical
system vulnerabilities and collaborated with senior engineers to develop recommendations for addressing risks.
• Designed a standardized issue-tracking system using GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM) to organize client
design changes with a corresponding process flow diagram; identified expanded implementation opportunities.
• Performed verifications on engineering calculations and reports involving seismic analysis, chronic and surface
oxidation, structural loads, weld parameters, design changes, and reports regarding industry best practices.
Summit Engineers, Arlington, VA, Electrical Engineering Intern Summer 2022 – Summer 2024
• Marked up and revised electrical plans using VectorWorks, AutoCAD, and by hand.
• Designed lighting and electrical plans for large scale projects, including storage jobs and apartment complexes.
• Calculated load requirements for various buildings’ circuits using reflected ceiling plans.
• Started through PRIME Internship Program, invited to work after the program ended and following summers.
Stantec, Arlington, VA, Intern Summer 2021
• Designed awnings and created sunlight renderings for a new middle school using SketchUp and Sefaira.
• Presented in team meetings to senior management and participated in on-site visits.
PROJECTS
Supersonic Rivet Deformation, Group Lead Summer 2025
• Investigated the aerodynamic impact of rivet protrusions on supersonic airfoils using ANSYS Fluent to assess
implications for drag and fuel efficiency.
• Built and troubleshot 2D supersonic CFD models, validating stagnation points, oblique shock behavior, and
inlet shockwave reflections against theoretical predictions.
• Gained hands-on experience with CFD geometry preparation, meshing limitations, and boundary conditions.
Fixed Wing, Member Fall 2024 - Present
• Used SolidWorks, 3D printing, and Laser cutting to build an aircraft with an 800 mm wingspan from scratch.
Autonomous Temperature Sensor, Project Lead Spring 2024
• Designed an automatic temperature sensor using AutoCAD, Arduino, 3D-Printing, SolidWorks, and C++.
LEADERSHIP
United States Soccer Federation (USSF), Grassroots Soccer Referee 2017 – Present
• Serve as center and assistant referee for highest level youth soccer matches, including State Cup semifinals.
