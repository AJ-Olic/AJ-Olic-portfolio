      "I am a 3rd year mechanical engineering student at Northeastern University, studying with a minor in aerospace engineering. Professionally, my goal is to be at the forefront of the engineering industry.",
      "Throughout my academic experience, I have had numerous professional experiences, including internships spanning from architecture to electrical engineering, and a co-op with a wide variety of disciplines.",
      "I’ve loved engineering for as long as I can remember. It provides the unique opportunity to solve complex challenges with critical thinking.",
      "I am currently involved in Northeastern’s Fixed Wing club, where we are building multiple RC planes from scratch. Outside of Academics I am an avid traveler (visiting 60 countries across 6 continents), as well as a soccer fanatic, participating as a coach, player, and referee."

      "Some of the work did include conducting a System Vulnerability Review for the Reactor Coolant System and the Chemical and Volume Control System at an operating nuclear plant by analyzing 10+ years of plant data (LTAMS, VMAS, CRs, CARs, IRIS), interviewing plant personnel, and benchmarking against industry best practices. Through this process I identified critical system vulnerabilities and collaborated with senior engineers to develop recommendations to properly address key risks.",
      "Additionally, I designed a standardized issue-tracking system using GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM) to organize client design changes with a corresponding process flow diagram; identified expanded implementation opportunities.",
      "Another face of my work included verifying engineering calculations and reports involving seismic analysis, chronic and surface oxidation, structural loads, weld parameters, design changes, and industry best practice reports.",

      "I was initially given this internship as a junior in high school, to assist as an architectural engineer designing electrical fixtures. I earned a strong report with my boss and was invited to return in future summers. Some of the work included marking up and revising electrical plans using Vector Works, AutoCAD, and by hand.",
      "I also designed lighting and electrical plans for large scale projects, including storage jobs and apartment complexes.  Calculated load requirements for various buildings’ circuits using reflected ceiling plans. I started through PRIME Internship Program, invited to work after the program ended and following summers."
